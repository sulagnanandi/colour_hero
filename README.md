A fun, graphical game with a storyline to teach kids the basics of colour theory (warm/cool colours, mixing colours, complementary colours in three separate levels) made with Processing. Created by Sulagna Nandi and Jessica Chen in January 2021. To play this game, download Processing (from processing.org), download and open the PDE file in this repository, and click the IDE's run button in the top left corner. The game will start with a splash screen and then the option to read brief instructions, start the game with an introduction to Colourville and the Evil Crayon Trio, or quit the game. Each of the three levels (warm/cool colours, mixing colours, complementary colours) starts with a short interactive lesson and then practice problems with randomized colours (warm/cool buttons for level 1, 12-colour palette for levels 2 and 3). The player must get ten problems correct per level to move on, reinforcing thorough learning.
